Recheck with `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/ref/tags/{tag}`. When object.type is
`tag`, follow object.url until object.type is `commit`. Cross-check the official
release notes before accepting a Dependabot update. A mutable major tag is only the
lookup source; the workflow itself always executes the recorded full commit.

Permissions: ordinary CI/readme/contracts/release validation use contents:read.
CodeQL adds security-events:write. Scorecard adds security-events:write and
id-token:write for public result publication. Only the gated publication job adds
contents:write (draft/assets/finalization), id-token:write (OIDC) and
attestations:write. Checkout never persists credentials. No pull_request_target or
write-token job executes PR code.
